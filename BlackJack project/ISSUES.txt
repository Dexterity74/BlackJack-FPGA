dealer is being dealt 3 cards during deal phase (expected 2 cards)

dealer hand 19, player hand 7 resulted in going to S_RESULT_WIN (expected LOSE)

gameState goes from S_PLAYER_CHOICE straight to Draw to 17. Why??? How???

Initial cards are predictable since RNG counter increments with clock.
Must rely on KEY push to deal cards so there is an undeterminable amount
of time between each card draw.

player's card is drawn on posedge(clk) and KEY is pressed. This could
potentially draw multiple cards in an instance if the player holds
the button down. Card draw for player must occur on negedge(KEY).
